# Machine-Learning-Technique-to-Detect-Hardware-Trojan
Detecting Hardware Trojan using Machine Learning Techniques and deep learning models.I am using CasLab algorithm.

# Description of CasLab-HT algorithm
We used the design tool, Design Compiler NXT from Synopsys for the dataset's feature extraction
The features consist via area and power characteristics of the circuits. In total they were used 50 area and power features.
7 Machine Learning models for the detection and classification of Trojan Free and Trojan Infected circuits, based on Gate Level Netlist phase and features for Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) circuits.

## Requirements
1. Python  3.12.1 or the latest
2. Numpy
3. Tensorflow
4. Keras
5. xgboost ```pip install xgboost```

## Run
To run the program use ```python3 main.py```

## Disclaimer
Please submit issues and how to improve it in a more efficient way.You can add more data sets to make this more effective.
Thank you;
